# Toku's Automata

## Premise

This library is one created by myself and a group of friends progressing through the game [bitburner](https://danielyxie.github.io/bitburner/) on Steam.

Please do not take this as valid JavaScript, nor any attempt to actually hack anything as it is only to solve problems presented by the idler game itself and any reference or allusion to hacking is fictional.

## How-To

1. Install the bitburner addon in VSCode.
1. Establish the .vscode/settings.json as implied in this repo
1. Grab the API token from the Steam game itself to populate the settings.json
1. Go wild.

## Notes

Anything here is a spoiler to the game itself, don't look through this unless you want to see implementations to the games challenges.
