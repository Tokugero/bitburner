/* Given the following array of arrays of numbers representing a 2D matrix, return the elements of the matrix as an array in spiral order:

    [
        [43,26, 7, 8,39]
        [37, 3,49,21,12]
        [48,13,27,17,19]
        [ 4,30,24,37,28]
        [21,27,12, 3,47]
        [16,10,29,15, 1]
    ]

Here is an example of what spiral order should be:

    [
        [1, 2, 3]
        [4, 5, 6]
        [7, 8, 9]
    ]

Answer: [1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 8 ,7, 4, 5]

Note that the matrix will not always be square:

    [
        [1,  2,  3,  4]
        [5,  6,  7,  8]
        [9, 10, 11, 12]
    ]

Answer: [1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 12, 11, 10, 9, 5, 6, 7] */
